# Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index.

# Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences.

# A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string 
# by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of 
# the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads 
# the same forward and backward.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "leetcodecom"
# Output: 9
# Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "ete" for the 1st subsequence and "cdc" for the 2nd subsequence.
# The product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "bb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.
# The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "accbcaxxcxx"
# Output: 25
# Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "accca" for the 1st subsequence and "xxcxx" for the 2nd subsequence.
# The product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25. 

# Constraints:
#     2 <= s.length <= 12
#     s consists of lowercase English letters only.
